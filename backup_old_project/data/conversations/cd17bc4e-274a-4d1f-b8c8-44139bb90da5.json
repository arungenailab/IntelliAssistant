Focusing on the numerical attributes, we see a wide range of values.  The average expense ratio is 1.2%, with some funds as low as 0.05% and others as high as 3.17%.  Fund sizes vary dramatically, averaging \u20b919,372 Cr but ranging from \u20b91 Cr to a substantial \u20b92,85,203 Cr.  Fund age averages around 9 years, with the youngest being just 1 year old and the oldest having operated for 27 years.\n\nPerformance metrics also show significant variation.  The average 1-year return is 12.1%, but ranges from -25.5% to 76.7%.  Similar variability is observed in 3-year (10.7% average, ranging from -10.9% to 36.9%) and 5-year returns (10.3% average, ranging from -1.3% to 25.1%).  Risk metrics like Sortino, Alpha, Standard Deviation (SD), Beta, and Sharpe ratios also show dispersion, suggesting diverse investment strategies and risk profiles across the funds.  For instance, the Sharpe ratio averages 0.9 but ranges from -1.3 to 3.2, indicating varying levels of risk-adjusted return.  Finally, the \"rating\" feature, likely representing a star rating system, averages 3.6, ranging from 1 to 5.  This overview suggests a complex investment landscape with opportunities for diverse investment choices based on risk appetite and return expectations.\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "17163dfa-0aa4-4e06-93ce-baa09f1c0890", "timestamp": "2025-03-12T09:25:49.052472", "type": "text", "role": "user", "content": "Which fund has the highest sip amount?", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "6670cde9-3548-42b1-af17-48fdea3e92d8", "timestamp": "2025-03-12T09:25:50.384635", "type": "text", "role": "assistant", "content": "The fund with the highest minimum SIP amount is \"ICICI Prudential Regular Savings Fund\" with a minimum SIP of \u20b910,000.\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "44fb9871-5d8f-451a-9057-8f43980f733b", "timestamp": "2025-03-12T09:26:03.470370", "type": "text", "role": "user", "content": "What is the CAGR for this fund?", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "34a8b2fa-c21b-420d-9c96-47701f99903f", "timestamp": "2025-03-12T09:26:05.837197", "type": "text", "role": "assistant", "content": "While the provided dataset contains 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year returns, it does not directly include the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR).
