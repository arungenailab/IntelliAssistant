Each salesperson would have a dedicated bar, and the height of each bar would represent their total sales amount.\n\nThe bars would be ordered descending from left to right, starting with Jardine (highest sales) and ending with Howard (5th highest sales).  This allows for easy visual comparison of the top performers.  The graph would clearly show that Jardine has significantly higher sales than the others, followed by Gill, Sorvino, Jones, and Howard, who have relatively similar sales figures to each other.\n", "metadata": {}}]}
