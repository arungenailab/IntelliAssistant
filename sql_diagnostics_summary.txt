    SQL EXECUTION DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY REPORT
===============================================

ISSUE:
------
The 'Show list of clients' query is correctly converted to SQL (SELECT * FROM Clients) but returns no results, 
despite the Clients table existing and having data when directly accessed.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
-------------------
1. Database Connection Issues:
   - SQL Server connection fails with all attempted connection methods
   - Connection errors indicate SQL Server may not be running or is not accessible
   - The IntelliAssistant database appears to exist but cannot be accessed with current credentials

2. Column Name Mapping Issues:
   - There is a mismatch in column naming conventions between:
     a) Database (lowercase_snake_case): client_id, first_name, last_name, etc.
     b) Frontend (PascalCase): ClientID, ClientName, etc.
   - The API response formatting was not preserving original column casing

3. SQLServerConnector Implementation Issues:
   - The class was missing a proper close() method (added during diagnostics)
   - Error handling did not provide sufficient diagnostics when no results were returned

4. API Endpoint Issues:
   - The response format needed to be standardized for consistency
   - Enhanced error diagnostic information was needed for troubleshooting

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
---------------------
1. Database Connection:
   - Added multiple connection retry options with different server names and drivers
   - Enhanced error messaging to provide clear diagnostics
   - Properly closing connections with the new close() method

2. Column Name Handling:
   - Updated the API to preserve original column names and case from the database
   - Enhanced the frontend mapping to handle both original and mapped column names
   - Added diagnostic logging to track column name transformations

3. SQLServerConnector Improvements:
   - Added close() method to properly manage database connections
   - Enhanced error handling and logging for connection errors
   - Added diagnostics for table existence and row count when no results are returned

4. API Response Standardization:
   - Standardized the response format with consistent error handling
   - Added more diagnostic information in error responses
   - Ensured detailed logging at each step of the process

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Verify SQL Server is running and accessible
   - Check SQL Server Configuration Manager
   - Verify Windows Services shows SQL Server is running
   - Check firewall settings allow SQL connections

2. Test connection with SQL Server Management Studio
   - Try both Windows Authentication and SQL Authentication
   - Verify the IntelliAssistant database exists
   - Check permissions on the database and Clients table

3. For deployment:
   - Update connection parameters in config.py with correct server name
   - Ensure the application has appropriate permissions to access the database
   - Add automated connection health checks on application startup

CONCLUSION:
----------
The primary issues appear to be:
1. SQL Server connection issues - the server may not be running or accessible
2. Column name mapping differences between database and frontend expectations

The code changes implemented should address these issues once the SQL Server connection problems are resolved.
